## Motivation

In the digital age, image authenticity is crucial due to the ease of manipulating images with sophisticated editing tools. Forged images can lead to fraud, misinformation, and other malicious activities. DEEPFORGE aims to leverage deep learning technology in a mobile app that is widely available and easy to use, helping users identify fake objects in RGB images, thereby contributing to a secure and trustworthy digital landscape&#8203;: citation[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## Problem Statement

The rise of sophisticated image editing tools has increased the prevalence of forged images, which compromise authenticity and lead to misinformation and deception. Detecting these forged images is critical for maintaining digital content integrity. Current methods are either manual, computationally intensive, or lack accurate prediction capabilities. DEEPFORGE addresses these challenges by offering an efficient, accessible solution that leverages deep learning algorithms for forgery detection&#8203;:citation[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Objectives

- **Data Collection and Preparation:**
  - Collect diverse datasets of forged RGB images, including copy-move and splicing examples.
  - Preprocess images and labels for YOLO format compatibility and perform data augmentation&#8203;:citation[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- **Model Development and Training:**
  - Implement the YOLO v8n algorithm with pre-trained weights from the COCO dataset.
  - Train the model using the prepared dataset, optimizing hyperparameters for accuracy&#8203;:citation[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

- **Evaluation and Validation:**
  - Assess model performance on a separate validation dataset to measure accuracy and generalization capabilities&#8203;:citation[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

- **Application Development:**
  - Develop a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter.
  - Integrate the trained model using `flutter_vision` and `tflight_flutter` packages&#8203;:citation[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
